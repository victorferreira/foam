# Next.js

Next.js is a framework [[Javascript]] built on top of [[React]] that allows a SPA application to run using the [[node-js.md]] runtime, allowing SPA apps to have SSR (server-side rendering) and API endpoints in the same app.

## The API

These are the main components provided by Next that are different from a standard [[React]] app.

- next/link: Enables client-side transitions between routes
- next/head: Allows developers to append elements to the `<head>` of the rendered page
- next/router: A hook for accessing the router object inside components on your application
