From the [docs:](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/contexts.html)

> [[Phoenix]] projects are structured like Elixir and any other Elixir project â€“ we split our code into contexts. A context will group related functionality, such as posts and comments, often encapsulating patterns such as data access and data validation. By using contexts, we decouple and isolate our systems into manageable, independent parts.
