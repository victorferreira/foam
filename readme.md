# Foam

We've created a few Bubbles (markdown documents) to get you started.

Feel free to use them or delete them. Your Foam, your rules.

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorised later
- [[todo]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[inbox]: inbox "Inbox"
[todo]: _site/todo "Todo"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
