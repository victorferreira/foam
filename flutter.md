# Flutter

Flutter is a [[Dart]] framework to build cross-platform applications, specially on mobile.

## StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget

When writing an app, you’ll use two types of widgets: StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget. A StatelessWidget is just what it sounds like — a widget with no state. A StatelessWidget is created once, and never changes its appearance. A StatefulWidget dynamically changes state based on data received, or user input.

The important difference between stateless and stateful widgets is that StatefulWidgets have a State object that stores state data and carries it over across tree rebuilds, so it’s not lost.
