# Next.js

Nex.js is a framework built on top of [[React]] that allows a SPA application to run on top of [[Node]] allowing to have SSR (server-side rendering).

## The API
These are the main components provided by Next that are different from a standard [[React]] app.

- next/link: Enables client-side transitions between routes
- next/head: Allows developers to append elements to the `<head>` of the rendered page
- next/router: A hook for accessing the router object inside components on your application
