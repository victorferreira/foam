# Supervised [[Machine Learning]]

## What it is?

[[Machine Learning]] systems that learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on data that was never seen before.

## Labels

A label is the thing we're predicting — the `y` variable in a simple linear regresssion. The label vould be future price of wheat, the kind of animal shown in a picture, the meaning of an audio clip, or hjust about anything.

## Features

A feature is an input variable — the `x` variable in a simple linear regretion. A simple machine learning project might use a single feature, while a more sophisticated machine learning project could use millions of features, specified as:

$k_{x+1}$, $k_{n+2}$, ..., $k_{n}$
