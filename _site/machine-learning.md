What is a [[Convolutional Neural Network]]?
In [[machine learning]], a classifier assigns a class label to a data point. For example, an image classifier produces a class label (e.g, bird, plane) for what objects exist within an image. A [[convolutional neural network]], or CNN for short, is a type of classifier, which excels at solving this problem!

regressions are for continous data, and classifiers for discreat data.
