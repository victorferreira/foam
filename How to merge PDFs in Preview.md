## [How to merge PDFs in Preview](https://setapp.com/how-to/merge-pdf-on-mac)

Preview is Apple’s native image and PDF viewer built for macOS. The app is primarily used to fill out PDF forms, add signatures as well as combine PDF files or specific pages across PDFs. Here’s the basic guide on how to use Preview for PDF management. 

To merge PDFs in Preview:  

1.  Open PDF 1 in the Preview app
2.  Make sure the thumbnails are visible: View > Thumbnails
3.  Select a page thumbnail after which you want to insert a new file
4.  Go to Edit > Insert > Page from File > Open to insert PDF 2
5.  To save the changes, click on File > Export as PDF. 

To insert specific pages into PDFs: 

1.  Open both PDFs you want to combine in Preview
2.  Make sure the thumbnails are visible in both documents: View > Thumbnails
3.  Press and hold Command, select page thumbnails you want to move to the other file, and let go of Command
4.  Drag the thumbnails onto the other PDF file and drop them wherever you want the pages to appear
5.  To save the changes, click on File > Export as PDF.

Once you combine PDF files, you can continue editing to reach your desired output: 

-   Drag a page thumbnail to any location to reorder pages. 
-   Select a page thumbnail > Tools > Rotate Left/Right to rotate pages. 
-   To remove a page, select the thumbnail > Edit > Delete. 

That’s basically the whole toolkit Preview covers in terms of PDF merge. Unfortunately, even these features can be pretty limited in some situations: 

-   **Loses scripts**. This is why using Preview with PDFs that contain forms isn’t the best idea. 
-   **Fails with signatures**. Unlike popular PDF editors, Preview doesn’t allow you to upload signatures in case you want to add them to a merged file. You can only draw with your touchpad or take a picture with a front camera — which is not always possible. 
-   **Slows down your system if you combine large files**. 

The alternatives are easy to find. And if you’re working with PDFs on a regular basis — expecially large files and extensive edits — you should probably get a reliable third-party PDF editor.
