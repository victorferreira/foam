# Phoenix

Phonix is a [[Elixir]] framework to build web applications




To sum things up...
-------------------

We've covered a lot of concepts in this chapter so make sure you understand them well before moving on. Here are the main takeaways:

1.  The **router** connects an endpoint with a controller function through a route.
    
2.  The **controller** defines the functions, and gathers data in them that it passes to a view.
    
3.  The **view** transforms this data to make it easy to consume before rendering a template.
    
4.  The **template** contains HTML code (and eventually some EEx).
    

Now that you have a grip on these concepts, we're going to start building our real application in the next chapter!
